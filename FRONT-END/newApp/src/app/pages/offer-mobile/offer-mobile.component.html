                    <p>
                        Newry is a consulting firm focused on driving growth for innovation leadership at global
                        companies. Since 1987, we have been helping our clients identify and pursue
                        opportunities in new markets and technologies. Our clients are typically innovators in
                        materials science, polymers and chemicals, industrial systems, and components, or
                        finished goods. Our long-standing professional relationships are proof of our high
                        success rate in delivering results above and beyond expectations.

                        Newry recruits, employs, contracts, trains, compensates, and promotes regardless of
                        race, religion, color, national origin, sex, disability, age, veteran status, and other
                        protected statuses as required by applicable law.

                    <p>
                        As a Part-Time Research Contractor engaged with Newry, you will help our project teams
                        discover growth opportunities for our clients by investigating technical publications,
                        trade and academic journals, and other secondary data sources (e.g., patents, press
                        releases, company websites, earnings reports, etc.). Your thorough review of these
                        sources could lead our clients to innovate on applications with novel materials, launch
                        a new product concept, or venture into a new market. Our project teams will collaborate
                        with you to set weekly goals and review your discoveries. This is a project-based
                        opportunity that will include weekly compensation for services performed.

                        Our ideal contractor will have 15-20 or more hours per week available for the duration
                        of the project and is able to work remotely. Interested contractors must have internet
                        access, the ability to participate in weekly phone calls, and access to a laptop.

                        Based on performance, the applicant may be re-engaged for additional future projects or
                        recurring needs within the firm.

                        You have excellent academic credentials and are participating in or have completed a

                        comfortable reading and analyzing technical or scientific documents and extracting

                        to deeply analyze problems, and strong written communication skills. You can demonstrate
